Place PNG screenshots here to have them render in the project README.

Recommended filenames (referenced by README.md):
- gui-overview.png       (full client window showing tabs & transport)
- sequencer.png         (close-up of sequencer grid with orange active cells)
- transport.png         (transport controls and inline BPM knob)

Recommended sizes:
- Full-window overview: ~1200×700 (or similar aspect ratio)
- Close-ups: ~800×400 or smaller

How to capture on Windows:
1. Run the app: build\Debug\lan_jam_client_gui.exe (or Release)
2. Press Alt+PrtScn to capture the active window, then paste into Paint or an editor and save as PNG.
3. Place the saved PNG files in this folder and commit.

After adding files, refresh the GitHub preview or re-open README.md in a Markdown viewer to see images render.
